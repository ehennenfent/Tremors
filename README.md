# Tremors
Earthquake mapping application for the fall 2016 Here Maps hackathon @ IIT. 

Tremors is a scientific application designed to help researchers better understand the inner workings of our planet. When you install the app on your phone, it runs in the background and passively collects the previous two minutes of your accelerometer data. In the event of an earthquake in your area, it records your GPS location and transmits the data to our server where it will be used to create high-resolution maps of the seismic activity. 

*By installing Tremors, you agree that we can collect your GPS location and accelerometer data at any time.*  

BUT 

Tremors respects your privacy. No personally-identifiable information will be sent to our server, and data will only be collected in bulk - when we collect your data, we'll be collecting it alongside the data of everyone else affected by the earthquake. We also promise to publicly disclose all data collection on our website, along with names and contact information for the institutions we provide data to.
